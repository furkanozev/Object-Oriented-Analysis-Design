In PDF, it was requested to implement the normal state first, then to implement it by adding the camera factor.
So, in both cases, I added my codes to the file.

First Desing without HiTech MOBESE -> in Part3_1 > TrafficLight folder
Second Desing with HiTech MOBESE -> in Part3_2 > HiTechTrafficLight folder

In Second Desing, HiTech class is included with Observer Design Pattern.
